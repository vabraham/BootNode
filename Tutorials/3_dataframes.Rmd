This document will go over some of the basic functionality in R. It can be used in a couple of ways. You can press the **Knit HTML** button in the toolbar to view the entire document either in the viewer pane in the bottom-right of the RStudio interactive development environment (IDE) or in a separate HTML window. You can select the output type by pressing the down arrow to the right of the **Knit HTML** button.

You can also run through the code in this document line-by-line by pressing the **Run** button, or chunk-by-chunk by pressing the **Chunks** button in the toolbar and then selecting **Run Next Chunk**.

These tutorial documents are meant to build upon each other so please make sure to review any earlier documents prior to starting this one.

###Creating a dataframe from scratch
Dataframes are at the core of data analysis in R. They differ from matrices in that each column can be of a different data type. Matrices generally contain only numeric values. They can be created in multiple ways. The most basic way to create a dataframe is using the data.frame() command. Check out the help function - ?data.frame, for additional details. Note that the number of rows must be the same for all columns in a matrix.
```{r}
# Create a sample dataframe of athlete data
a.name <- c("Vin", "Mel", "Don", "Sal", "Sonny", "Arbita")
a.age <- c(23, 31, 21, 27, 34, 24)
a.height <- c(66, 69, 71, 70, 73, 71) #in inches
a.weight <- c(160, 178, 155, 160, 180, 158)
# Without specifying that a.sex is factor, R will automatically assume individual string characters.
a.sex <- as.factor(c("male", "male", "male", "female", "male", "female"))
# Combine all the vectors into a single dataframe
df <- data.frame(a.name, a.age, a.height, a.weight, a.sex)
# Print the dataframe
df
# Check out the dataframe class
class(df)
# Check out the class of the individual dataframe columns
str(df)
# See additional details about the dataframe using the summary() command
summary(df)
```
Dataframes can also come from other sources. R has an internal library of dataframes to use.
```{r}
# List the internal library of R datasets
data()
```

###Uploading a dataframe from a local source
You can import dataframes directly from a local source. Under **Files** in the bottom-right panel, click **Upload** to upload files directly to the server. Files will automatically appear in the working directory of the RStudio server instance you are running. To check where that directory is, type `getwd()`. All the files you create and save will appear in this directory.

To read the data from the source file, you can use the read.table() command. Check out the help command `?read.table` for more information. There should be a file called "cardata.csv" in the working directory, you can load it into RStudio as follows.
```{r}
car <- read.csv("/home/radmin/Tutorials/data_images/cardata.csv")
```
The dataframe "car" should now appear in the global environment section of RStudio

###Importing dataframes from the internet
You can import dataframes from the internet using the read.table() commands as well, just replace the local directory path with a url.
```{r}
# Load credit screening data from the UCI machine learning repository.
url="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/credit-screening/crx.data"
mydata=read.csv(url, header=FALSE)
```

###Exploring a dataframe
Once you've loaded a dataframe, you can begin to explore to explore the data. We've looked at some of these commands above like `str()` and `summary()`.
```{r}
# Get a summary of the car dataset
summary(car)
# Display the data structure
str(car)
# Get the names of all the columns in the dataset
names(car)
# Display the first 6 rows of the dataframe
head(car)
# Display the last 6 rows of the dataframe
tail(car)
# Count the number of rows
nrow(car)
# Count the number of columns
ncol(car)
# View individual rows
car[1,]
car[2,]
# View individual columns
car[,1]
car[,2]
# You can also use the "$" and "tab" after the dataframe to view individual columns
car$mpg
car$cylinders
```
![3_3](data_images/3_3.png)
```{r}
# Selecting multiple rows
car[1:4,]
# Selecting multiple columns
car[,1:2]
# Selecting different rows
car[c(1,3,4,6),]
# Selecting different columns
car[,c(1,3)]
# Selecting individual elements of a dataframe
car[1,1]
car[1,"mpg"]
```
